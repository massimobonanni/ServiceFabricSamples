# Fire and Forget #

This demo shows how you can implement a simple "Fire and Forget" scenarious.
You must use this kind of scenario when you want to be sure that a long time operation doesn't block any other actor.
The ActorDemo actor implements the interface IFireAndForget:

    public interface IFireAndForgetActor : IActor
    {
    	Task DoOperationWithCallbackAsync(ActorReference caller, string operationPayload, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default(CancellationToken));
    }

The ActorReference is used by the ActorDemo clients communicate to the ActorDemo their own reference in terms of ServiceUri and Id.

The ActorDemo clients can call the DoOperationWithCallBackAsync to execute a long time  operation but they have to implement the interface ICallbackActor

    public interface ICallbackActor : IActor
    {
    	Task CallbackAsync(ActorReference caller, string callbackPayload, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default(CancellationToken));
    }

and the ActorDemo, when it finishs the long time operation, will call back the client actor using the ActorReference and the ICallbackActor.
Of course, the payloads used in both IFireAndForgetActor and ICallbackActor may be whatever you need, in this simple scenarious, I use a string.

To run the demo, you can run the TestConsole with this command line:

    TestConsole.exe callbackoperation <servuceUri> <actorId> <operationPayload>

Sample: Call the actor with service uri fabric:/ActorModelDemo/ClientActor and id "test" and use "Operation payload" as payload for the long time operation.
	
    TestConsole.exe callbackoperation fabric:/ActorModelDemo/ClientActor test "Operation payload"
